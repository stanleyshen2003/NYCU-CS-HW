# Cellphone Rating System
NYCU Database Final Project - Cellphone Raitng System <br>
[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfr9eekEX3Y)

### Introduction
  When we are choosing a cell phone, you have to compare their functions
and their overall evaluation given by the other users. We develop a website for
anyone who is having trouble choosing cell phones. In our application, you can
have quick access to all the popular cell phone information, and you can also
filter the cell phones according to your preferences. In addition, we have made
some analysis based on a questionnaire, so you can know how the public or a
particular group of people think of cell phones.

### Website Usage
Since out application did not deploy onto the server, we need to use it in the
local host. Here is how we do:
After installing the source code, Django and other package in our environment,
we can enter “python manage.py runserver” in the terminal.
